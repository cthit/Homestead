# digIT Homestead

The digIT Laravel local development environment.

## Manual intervention required
Before running ```vagrant up``` there are a few steps that need to be taken:

1. Fetch LDAP data. See the wiki
2. You **need** the data and code directory
3. You may need to edit *Homestead.yaml* and edit where folders are mapped.
4. Run ``` vagrant up ```
